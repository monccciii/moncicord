It will have:
- Servers
- Direct Messages
- Friend System
- Mobile Version

Progress: 60%(?)
To Do:
- add Update and Delete
- revamp UI
- create friend system (must be loaded in some way, possibly localstorage -> may need a whole page to gather account info and load into localstorage)

Backlog:
- create server/channel system + joining/leaving server system (create servers, talk in channels, leave servers)
- learn about and find out how to use JWT
- create mobile (react native) ver.

PROJECT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD.

During the creation of this project, I learned a lot about database organization and learned more about responsive design.  Database organization has always mystified me, how can you organiza data if they're not in nested databases/collections?  However, I learned through much (much) research and YouTube videos.  Responsive design was also a confusing concept to me.  I didn't understand (or know) that the site could look different, and I previously assumed that it automatically was responsive.  Also, through this project, I learned about useEffect, useState, and other lifecycle methods.  Starting this project, I understood none of these except useState, but even that I lacked knowledge in.  Through repeated research and videos, I found out more and more and eventually found my way to writing code using these methods.  I really wanted to give up, truly.  I felt the voices in my head telling me, "You won't understand these methods.  You won't understand how to design a site.  You won't understand how to use a database" but I tried my best to shut them up and complete my goal. Continuing with this project would be great, however, now that I know most of the functionality, it would be a waste of time as I am not learning something new.  Now, that I have grasped a stronger idea of front-end design and back-end functionality, I shall move onto projects that use more skill and expertise.  My long term goals is to be able to create high-level apps by myself and kickstart a startup.  My short term goals are to gather more internship experience, get my first job, and complete a few freelance gigs. I will not be aborting this project, but I will not be working on this often.

Possible upcoming projects:
- Snapchat Clone (React Native)
- Instagram Clone (React Native)
- Finance Management App (React Native)

I'm very excited to work on mobile apps, so creating my debut with React Native will be great.
Thanks to all who were interested in this project,
Monci
